# STEP 1

# 1. Initialize a gift list as an array
# 2. Display welcome message
# 3. Give options to user and store his answer (gets.chomp)
# 4. Check the action using an if statement (or case statement)
# 5. Execute the relevant action (Placeholder for now)
# 6. Create the loop (while/until)

# STEP 2

# LIST
# Iterate over the array using each_with_index
# Display the contents using puts and reading into the hash

# ADD
# 1. Ask the user for the name and capture input (new_name)
# 2. Ask for the price and capture input (new_price)
# 3. Build the gift as a hash
# 4. Push the gift into gift_list

# DELETE
# 1. Ask the user to pick the index of the gift to delete
# 2. Then we delete at the index (array.delete_at(index))

# STEP 3

# 1. Add a new "mark" action
# 2. Add a new 'when' in our case statement
# 3. Ask the user which item to check/uncheck
# 4. If the item is checked, we uncheck it
# 5. If the item is not checked, we check it
